Safe Home

Abstract

Keeping homes safe and healthy is always a priority. In today's modern era we can solve many problems that were not possible before. Homes must be kept safe from thefts and poisonous gas leakages which can be fatal as well as environment conditions which can cause fungus to walls and respiratory diseases. We will use sensors to check room conditions and then recommend possible actions, if conditions are not optimal. In case of a fatal gas leakage our system will respond accordingly.
 

1. Introduction

There have been quite a lot of fatal gas leakages in the past few years where there have been casualties, but still, we rely on old methods which are not efficient. In today's era we can solve these problems and save many lives. Apart from that the Environmental conditions of a room are very important. Respiratory problems are caused by inadequate room conditions like high humidity or low oxygen levels. Apart from that high humidity can cause fungus on walls which causes damage to material that can easily be avoided by using our proposed solution. The system will also have theft alerts features using motion detection and voice activation.
Up-till now there hasn't been a solution that tackles all the above-mentioned problems in a single package. We propose a one - solution for all the above-mentioned problems. This system will truly make homes a safer place.
2. Problem Statement

Inadequate room environment can be fatal for health, it can damage materials that are present in a room like walls, wood furniture etc. Early warning systems to address these issues critical issues are not present. Where Methane leakages can be fatal and have caused many casualties, lack of oxygen in the room can affect productivity. Fungus as a byproduct of high humidity causes damage to material that is present in a room and it also causes major health risks as quite a lot of respiratory problems originate from it.
Burglary is another major safety issue nowadays, to address this issue we need technology but while using it, we have to address privacy concerns as well, Motion detection can be used when home is empty but what about a robbery where already people are inside , motion detection won’t be able to detect an imposter in such a situation this is where this device will have another trick up its sleeve.
3.  	Problem Solution for the Proposed System
Our proposed system will solve the above-mentioned problem with different sensors that work as one, instead of buying a device that only measures one thing, our device will have the different sensors in one package, like it will measure oxygen level, humidity level, methane level and room temperature. Thus, making it a cost-effective device. Existing systems measure one thing at a time and monitoring needs to take place on spot, our device will connect to the internet and share its data on a server and through which a mobile application can fetch the data via an API. This way a user can monitor different levels remotely. In case of an emergency, our system will send SMS to the already entered emergency contacts. For theft report we will use motion detection which will be activated by the user while leaving his place. For the scenario of a robbery the user can speak a safe word for example “Jingo” which will trigger the device to send SMS to the list of people provided by the user and will inform them about the robbery.
We will learn,
●	Hardware software integration.
●	Mobile Application development.
●	Implementation of APIs to share data from sensors to mobile application.
